Current way:

If Not First Move Of Game:
	Unmake last move

Make Move
Check Wins
If terminal depth -> Return best utility

New Design:

Base Case:
	If any win in current position -> Return win status
	If at terminal depth -> Return utility calculation

Recursive case:
	for all children
		Make Move
		Calculate AB(depth-1, alpha, beta, maxplayer as boolean)
		Depth Normalise
		Unmake Move

		Check Cost Values and a,b



O move -> Minimising player
X move -> Maximising player
Alpha represents the highest score found so far (in this branch)
Beta reperesents the lowest score found so far (in this branch)

AB(depth, alpha, beta, bool maximising)
{
	
}
